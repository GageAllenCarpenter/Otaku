# Otaku
"Otaku" is a multifunctional project that combines a Discord bot and a website, catering to the interests and needs of anime and manga enthusiasts. The repository houses the code and resources for both components, allowing users to engage with the Otaku community through different platforms.

The Discord bot aspect of the project provides a range of features, such as anime and manga search, character information, airing schedules, recommendation systems, and interactive commands to enhance the server experience. It leverages Discord's API and various anime-related APIs to deliver up-to-date and relevant information.

The website component complements the Discord bot by offering a user-friendly interface accessible to a broader audience. Users can explore curated anime and manga recommendations, browse detailed information about their favorite series and characters, participate in discussions, and stay informed about upcoming events and releases. The website integrates with external APIs to provide real-time data and ensure an engaging and dynamic experience for users.

The "Otaku" GitHub repository serves as a central hub for collaboration, version control, and community contribution. It encompasses well-organized directories for the Discord bot and the website, facilitating easy maintenance and development. Developers can contribute to the project by adding new features, fixing bugs, improving performance, or suggesting enhancements.

By combining the power of a Discord bot and a user-friendly website, "Otaku" aims to create a vibrant community where anime and manga enthusiasts can connect, discover new content, and share their passion for Japanese pop culture.
